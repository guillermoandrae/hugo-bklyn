# bklyn
A Hugo theme for simple personal websites.

## Features
* Supports Custom CSS and JavaScript
* Outputs a web app manifest
* Generates a [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/) file

# Dark mode
This theme ships with a dark mode. By default, your site will transition into dark mode at night then back into normal mode during the day. Users can also toggle back and forth between normal and dark modes (when using the toggle, the last selected mode will always be used and will override the day/night functionality).
