# bklyn
A Hugo theme for simple personal websites.

## Features
* Supports Custom CSS and JavaScript
* Outputs a web app manifest
* Generates a [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/) file

# Dark mode
This theme ships with a dark mode. By default, your site will cycle between normal and dark mode depending on the time of day. Users can also manually toggle back and forth between normal and dark mode (when using the toggle, however, the last selected mode will always be used and will override the day/night functionality).
